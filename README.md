# A quartet game developed in Java

In 2005 I did my intermediate exam in my computer science class in high school. I was learning to code at that time and had to build an app as an exam.

## The story behind this "masterpiece"
I went to the [Besselgymnasium](https://besselgymnasium.de/) for my A levels. In the 12th grade everybody had to do a kind of "thesis" in a subject of choice.
As I loved the computer science class, I did my thesis there. 

## This is just for fun.
I did not change any line since then. So, this project is just here for entertainment purpose.
