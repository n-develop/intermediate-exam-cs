# A quartet game developed in Java

In 2005 I did my intermediate exam in my computer science class in high school. I was learning to code at that time and had to build an app as an exam.

## The story behind this "masterpiece"
I went to the [Besselgymnasium](https://besselgymnasium.de/) for my A levels. In the 12th grade everybody had to do a kind of "thesis" in a subject of choice.
As I loved the computer science class, I did my thesis there. I decided to develop a (more or less) simple quartet game.
It was simple enough so that I could do it in a couple of weeks, but also was complex enough (for a beginner) to do it as the intermediate exam.

And that's what you are looking at right now.

## Why is this stuff on GitHub?

I found the source code on an old CD and really wanted to save it. And as I have most on my code on GitHub, that was the place to go.
I could have created a private repository, but I thought it would be funny to share this. 

## Just one little change

When I did the original work, I scanned the cards of a real quartet game and used them in the project.
For this repository, I replaced all the images of the cards with a placeholder image, because I doubt that I'm allowed to use pictures of the real cards.
So can't really "play" this game, even if you checkout the repository and compile it, because the "real" cards are missing.

## This is just for fun.
I did not change any line since then. I did not refactor or rebuild any part of it. And that's on purpose. This project is just here for your entertainment purpose. 
It's really funny to see, how I coded around a couple of "challenges" back then.

So feel free to look at the code. Laugh at the code. Laugh at (the younger) me. That's all fine. That's what this repository is made for.
But please don't contact me to tell me that the code is crap. I already know. ;-)

## Version 2

After I finished the game, I extended it to support three different quartet games. You can find this version (I call it "version 2") in the "version-2" branch of this repository.
